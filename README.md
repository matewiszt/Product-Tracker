Android Basics Nanodegree Project 9

### Goal of the app
This app was part of my Android Basics Nanodegree program at <a href="http://udacity.com">udacity.com</a>. It is a stock management app: you can add, edit and delete products with price, image, quantity and description. You can also order the products if your shop has run out of them. The app is an exercise one so please take into account that it has some unproper funcionalities.

Used technologies:
- ContentProvider
- CursorAdapter
- Custom menu items
- Image picker
